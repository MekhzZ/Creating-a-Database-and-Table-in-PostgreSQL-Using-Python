# Creating a Database and Table in PostgreSQL Using Python

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to create a database and table in PostgreSQL using Python. It uses the psycopg2 library to establish a connection, execute queries, and manipulate the database. The project is aimed at beginners looking to integrate Python with PostgreSQL for database operations.

## Key Features
Establishing a connection to a PostgreSQL database using Python.
Creating a database and tables programmatically.
Basic data manipulation operations such as inserting and retrieving records.
Practical examples presented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity.

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (psycopg2)

## Learnings
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into:
- Setting up and managing a PostgreSQL server.
- Writing Python scripts to automate database operations.
- Using the psycopg2 library for database connections and queries.
- Integrating shell scripting and Python for enhanced database management.
- Working with Jupyter Notebook to document and execute code interactively.

This experience strengthened my understanding of relational databases and their integration with Python for backend development.
